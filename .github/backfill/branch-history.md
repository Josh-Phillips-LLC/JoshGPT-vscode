# Branch History Backfill

This commit exists only to enable a PR artifact for branch-history visibility.

Context:
- Initial JoshGPT VS Code PoC and license updates were merged directly during bootstrap.
- A PR could not be opened retroactively because there were no commits between this branch and `main`.

This PR should be treated as archival metadata and can be closed after review.
